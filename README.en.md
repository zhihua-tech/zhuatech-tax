# ZhuaTech TAX

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise finance, planning, settlement, and risk control.

ZhuaTech TAX provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise finance, planning, settlement, and risk control. It is designed for finance teams, business controllers, approvers, and operations managers, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise tax, self-hosted tax, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Finance teams, business controllers, approvers, and operations managers.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Entity** — Manage entity with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **User** — Coordinate user through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Filing** — Track filing metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Ledger Record** — Preserve ledger record evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Risk** — Expose risk in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Rule** — Connect rule to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.
